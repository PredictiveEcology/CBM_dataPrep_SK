## Overview

[CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) processes spatially explicit inputs for use in [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git) and [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git). In *SpaDES-speak*, it has two events, the `init` event (scheduled once) and the `readDisturbanceEvents` which processes disturbances (usually provided as rasters) into a table format used in [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git). [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) was designed for spatially explicit modelling and provides a wide variety of tools to support it. [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) makes use of these tools. All location specific or spatial information is process in this module. This module's inputs are study area and scenario specific making [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) the most idiosyncratic module of the [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) [deck](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html), meaning that this is the module that will require users to adapt to their available information for their study area. We use an example that simulates a scenario where remotely-sensed disturbances are simulated in the managed forests of Saskatchewan from 1985 to2011, as described in @boisvenue2016's (scenario = time horizon + disturbances). We suggest users wanting to run [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) for their study-area, modify this module, adapting their inputs to produce the outputs of [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git). The module would become **CBM_dataPrep_NewStudyArea**.

## Background
The default structure of [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) modules has the [`.inputObjects`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) function, and in the `.inputObjects` function of [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git), we make use of the [`reproducible::prepInputs`](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/prepInputs.html) function which is an important part of the [SpaDES](https://SpaDES.PredictiveEcology.org) toolkit (see the [SpaDES training manual](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/) for more details), enabling repeatable continuous workflows. [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) falls back to the defaults [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) parameters for running the SK managed forests, unless alternative information is provided by the user. 

Our example study area is defined by the object [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html). This object can be provided directly as a raster, as per our example, or created from shape files or by other means. Reminder: any R-code can replace current input processing examples in [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git). The characteristics (projection, resolution, etc.) of this [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) are transferred to other rasters used in the simulation via the function [`reproducible::prepInputs`](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/prepInputs.html). In our example, rasters for age (`ageRaster`), growth curves location (`gcIndexRaster`), and [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) (`ecoRaster`)  and [spatial unit](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) (`spuRaster`), link back to the default parameters for Canada. Yearly (in our example our time step is a year - run `times(simMngedSK)` to see `current`, `start`, and `end` time) disturbance rasters provide the type and location of disturbances. All rasters are matched to the [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) using the [`reproducible::prepInputs`](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/prepInputs.html) function. Defaults parameters are expected from the [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git) (`spinupSQL`, `species_tr`) and one table is provided [`cbmAdmin`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) for user convenience. In addition to location (study area or [`masterRaster`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html)) and inventory information (age, here provided as a raster), the user is expected to provide: growth curves ($m^3/ha$) that are linked to each pixel or stand (`userGcM3`), the leading species for each curve (`gcMeta`), and information about disturbances (`userDist`).

## Module functioning

Two central pieces are processed in [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git): the pixelGroups are created and disturbances are matched with disturbance matrices.

### Pixel Groups

[`pixelGroup`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) are unique combinations of age, growth curve (which means species), [spatial unit](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) and [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html). All pixels having identical age, growth curve, in the same spatial unit and ecozone share one `pixelGroup` number. The object `allPixelDT` has all the pixels in the `masterRaster`. The  `spatialDT` object is the long-form where each simulated pixel has its own line (no NAs), and `level3DT` lists only the pixel groups. In our example there are 1 347 529 pixels simulated (i.e., 1 347 529 lines in `spatialDT`) which are grouped in 739 pixelGroups for processing (i.e., 739 lines in `level3DT`). 

### Disturbances

The user identifies what disturbances occur on the landscape during the simulations. Our example points to a file that has the disturbance name and description, `userDist`. The table also provides a raster values that differentiates between disturbance types (in our example, we provide one raster per year, which has all disturbances in that year, each having a unique raster value, as opposed to one individual raster per year per disturbance type), and identifies if the disturbance is a whole stand disturbance or not. These disturbances need to be match to a disturbance matrix, which identifies the proportion of carbon transferred from one pool ([source_pool](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html)) to another pool ([sink_pool](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html)) when a disturbance occurs in that pixel. If there is more than one match (e.g., more than one type of fire), the user will be prompted to select from a list of disturbance matrices available for the study area, for each [spatial unit](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) and [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) combinations. The default matrices are provided in the Canada-wide defaults and are region ([spatial unit](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) and [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html)) specific. These are read-in by [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git) and available to the [CBM_dataPrep_SK](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_dataPrep_SK.git) module via the [simList()](https://predictiveecology.org/training/_book/simList.html). We provide an example of selection in our example. The user-prompts look like this:
**Camille: INSERT SCREEN SHOTS OF THE disturbance SELECTION PROCESS?**

There are 468 unique disturbance matrices identified in the defaults. Since root parameters and snag carbon transfer rates have hardwood and softwood specific rates, each disturbance has a hardwood and a softwood instance, which means we have 234 unique disturbances across Canada as defaults in this modelling system, one for hardwood and one for softwood. A user could add or modify the proportions transferred between pools to represent a disturbance (**NOTE THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN IN THE CSVs, and even then would that work? Does libcbm point to those files? what if we change them? QUESTION FOR SCOTT, VINI and SUSAN**). 
**Add a section on how one would modify the disturbance matrices**
**Add Vini's (or similar) disturbance matrix figure.

Parameters necessary for the [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) `spinup` event are added to the `level3DT` object by using the [CBM_defaults](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_defaults.git) output object `spinupSQL`. This includes a match to the historical disturbance matrix (wildfire) specific to this location (`historicDMtype`).

There are a series of helper functions in [CBMutils](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils.git) to help users explore and navigate disturbance matrices: 
- [spuDist](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/main/vignettes) for extracting the disturbances in a specific spatial unit,
- [simDist()](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/main/vignettes) which lists the distrubances used in a simulation, and
- [seeDist()](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/main/vignettes) which pulls out the proportions from source to sink pools.

Because growth curves can be identified by strata, multiple columns can be used to identify growth curves using the `curveID` object. In our example, only **gcids** is used.
